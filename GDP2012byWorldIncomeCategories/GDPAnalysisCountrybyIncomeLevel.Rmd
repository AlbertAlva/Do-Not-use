#Assignment
This assignment is a case study of the 2012 Gross National Product of the World.  It requires downloading
data from the web, tidying the data, merging data sets and analyzing the results.
1 Merge the data based on the country short code. How many of the IDs match?
2 Sort the data frame in ascending order by GDP (so United States is last). What is the 13th
country in the resulting data frame?
3 What are the average GDP rankings for the "High income: OECD" and "High income:
nonOECD" groups?
4 Plot the GDP for all of the countries. Use ggplot2 to color your plot by Income Group.
5 Cut the GDP ranking into 5 separate quantile groups. Make a table versus Income.Group.
How many countries are Lower middle income but among the 38 nations with highest
GDP?
##Deliverable
The deliverable is a Markdown file uploaded to Git Hub containing the following:
• Introduction to the project. The introduction should not start with “For my project I …”.
The introduction needs to be written as if you are presenting the work to someone who
has given you the data to analyze and wants to understand the result. In other words,
pretend it’s not a case study for a course. Pretend it’s a presentation for a client.

• Code for downloading, tidying, and merging data in a R Markdown file. The code should
be in a make file style, meaning that the source RMD document pulls in separate files for
importing data, cleaning the data, and data analysis.

• Brief explanations of the purpose of the code. The explanations should appear as a
sentence or two before or after the code chunk. Even though you will not be hiding the
code chunks (so that I can see the code), you need to pretend that the client can’t see
them.

• Code to answer the five questions above (plus the answers) in the same R Markdown file.

• Clear answers to the questions. Just the code to answer the questions is not enough, even
if the code is correct and gives the correct answer. You must state the answer in a
complete sentence outside the code chunk.

• Conclusion to the project. Summarize your findings from this exercise.




##Data
Two data sets were downloaded from cloudfrount.net:/
The Gross Domestic Product data for the 190 ranked countries:
      https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fdata%2FGDP.csv
  The educational data from this data set:
      https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fdata%2FEDSTATS_Country.csv

###Gathering Data
Gross Domestic Product data set was obtained from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fdata%2FGDP.csv
It contains Countries, World GDP Ranking and Gross Domestic Product for 2012.

The code reads two data sets comma delimited files from the internet.
 the file locations are:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fdata%2FGDP.csv
 SHA-1 hash of file is 18dd2f9ca509a8ace7d8de3831a8f842124c533d

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fdata%2FGDP.csv

The functions used were in the Basic package and the repmis package.
Required: gdata, tidyr, repmis
